          <p class="three-collumn-promo-content">I really didn't have too much time to put this together. It was originally supposed to be a preview of the designer before she showcased at New York Fashion Week, but that got pushed back and now this is supposed to go out next month after she presented with a small booklet during the show that I also designed. I have never really seen/put one of these together before, but I'll be working a lot more with her in the future. She is a Ghanaian-German married to an American. I tried to go with a minimal European feel.

          <p class="three-collumn-promo-content">Long time no post! My first version of this didn't save (apparently you can't drag and drop), so this may be shorter than I initially wanted. The company is called "Mardigras.ca", they are a party rental service. They cater to company parties, weddings, and generally to older audiences (no balloons or airbounce machines), their specific products are these: Tents, serving equipment, linens, BBQ & rotisserie, fountains, tables, dinnerware, flatware, chairs, cotton candy & popcorn, food warmers and glassware. Their old logo was clipart of a tent, and their current logo is their name in awkward type with a flag underneath it. They want something simple and modern, but bold, as they want their sign to be clearly visible from the highway (about 50m away). They liked their old tent logo, but they don't want to be known purely as a tent company, so they wanted steer away from it, however, I find a tent really covers all the bases for a party rental company. All these are pretty rough, no color has been added yet. I'll most likely do something lively, rainbow or simply warm colors. Which set/idea do you guys prefer most? @LauraMoraiti @ryantriddle @sarah_edwards @renwalker</p>

          <p class="three-collumn-promo-content">I used to try and keep my "master" CSS file as clean and valid as possible, but what with all the edge syntax and often necessary fall-backs, how many people actually strive for valid CSS nowadays? Remember the "Valid CSS" badges we used to add? I'm now finding it much more manageable when using a CSS preprocessor to include everything in the one file - including browser prefixes, my *display:inline fix, and also

          <p class="three-collumn-promo-content">Hello! This is my school assignment for the made up yogurt company, Amazing Frozen Yogurt! I made this website design in less than 24 hours, and it is all coded up. I used Twitter Bootstrap as a framework but since I had little time to complete it, I just focused on making it pretty. What do you think given the short time? Did I use too much color? Did I use too little? I know the social icons aren't centered, but imagine they are... And would you make them monocolored? For example, making them all have a color overlay so they look consistent? I appreciate any and all comments on the design because I am dedicated to becoming a better web designer/developer. Thanks for reading!!
